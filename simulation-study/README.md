# Simulation study
The simulation study was performed at [HPC2N](https://www.hpc2n.umu.se/). The R scripts are therefore meant to be called from a bash terminal. 

## Example
To reproduce an example of the simulation study, in bash, run 

'''bash
. example.sh
'''

## Full simulation study 
See the script `full_study.sh`. Please note that the file is not intended for running on a personal computer as the simulation study takes a lot of time to complete when not parallelized.
